| Marketboard        |                                | You should read the full description of items when you hover over them in the Market board. If you see "shop selling price," there is a regular vendor NPC in the world you can buy it from, assuming you have that area unlocked. People tend to buy from NPCs and resell on the marketboard at a higher price as the "lazy tax". If it says (restricted) it's likely a quest NPC/beast tribe NPC you need to unlock. Also: HQ items have better stats than normal quality and have higher materia meld stat caps!                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Poetics            |                                | Here’s the "typical" order to spend your poetics: 1. Class gear, having one set of each type of gear tends to be enough. Ex., all healers share the "healing" sets, 2. Buy items for future relics you want ("End of expansion" weapons. Older relics are just for glam, but the ShB relics are good for stats), 3. Buy unidentifiable ore and trade it for grade 3 thanalan topsoil in Idyllshire (to Bertana) and make nice gil. Never cap on poetics otherwise they’re wasted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Retainers          |                                | Retainers do a lot more for you than just hold stuff. They are basically your extra storage, your way to sell on the market board and a great source of rare materials/items through their Ventures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Grand Company      |                                | GC Seal priority: 1. VENTURES - You can buy retainer ventures here to use with your retainers.

| Gearing            | OUTDATED                       | 1st you'll craft your exarchic gear, 2nd you will upgrade exarchic gear to "augmented exarchic" using allagan tomestones of allegory in Eulmore. Since Allagan tomestones of Revelation have a weekly cap of 900, you'll then spend a few weeks getting them and getting any Cryptlurker gear that your BIS guide says to get from the balance... At this point you are more than ready to attempt savage raid content which will help you get the real "end game" edenmorn pieces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Crafting/Gathering | OUTDATED                       | Scrips are a currency for crafting and gathering. There are yellow (lv 50,60,70) and white (lv80) scrips and they are used to purchase more crafting materials, fishing lures, equipment for DoL/DoH and other stuff. You get them by gathering/crafting Collectables, or doing weekly turn-ins to special NPCs. You get cool rewards for doing turn-ins & getting "affection" increased w/ certain NPCs. Gathering collectables are specific items in specific nodes that have "collectability," not HQ/NQ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Retainers          |                                | Retainers can be either combat classes or gatherers. It doesn't matter what combat class you pick, cus they all get the same "ventures" to go on, but each gatherer can only gather items you've already gathered. They level according to how many ventures you send them on, but they will only level as high as your own class is. So make sure to pick a high level class or one you know you're gonna max soon. You give them "jobs" to do by using ventures purchased most efficiently with grand company seals                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Hunts              | A RANK                         | There are A ranks in every expansion. ARR has 1 per map, HW and beyond have 2 per map. ARR gives Allied seals, HW & SB give Centurio seals, SHB gives nuts. These are currencies used to trade for a multitude of items like dyeable class gear, minions, mounts, etc. Nuts are currently used to enhance end game gear as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Hunts              | RANKS                          | There are different "ranks" of monsters. You can tell these guys apart because they're an unusually high lv mob in contrast to the rest of the map, and they have a special icon next to their name. B ranks spawn every 5 minutes, A ranks spawn every 6 hours, and S ranks are super rare and require a trigger to spawn them every few days. A hunt train is a piece of content where players get together to kill all the A ranks in a particular expansion so everyone gets credit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Hunts              | S RANK                         | An S rank is around when you see a gray message in your chat box, saying "You sense the presence of a powerful mark." Do not attack it on your own. Groups will commonly set a “pull time” based off of the in-game time, “Eorzea time” (ex.: “pt 9:12”) - that way plenty of people can all come together and get points for the skill :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Hunts              | HUNT TRAIN ENMITY              | Typically you see tons of healers/tanks because the more you heal and the more enmity you generate the more credit we get towards the kill, which helps us max out the rewards we get from each kill. Healers should spam heals and tanks should spam ranged attacks and provoke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Combat             | OGCD, GCD                      | The game's skills are divided into two categories: Global Cool Downs (GCDs) and Off Global Cooldown (OGCDs) skills. GCDs happen every 2.5 seconds and OGCDs can be cast any time around that. The best way to improve your performance in game is to "ABC" - Always Be Casting. That means NEVER miss a GCD "window" (aka. you should always click a GCD when it's up, every 2.5 secs), and "Weave" in your OGCDs in between. This maximizes DPS and helps you get better at your class :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Chocobo Companion  |                                | Your Chocobo Companion is basically your buddy. It can fight with you, it can store items for you (ctrl + shift + i to access the chocobo saddle bag), and it follows you if you use a Gysahl Green item. It can only show up in non-town areas/maps (aka. where mobs spawn) and it can level up with you. You should put points into maxing out its healer stance first, then wherever you want. You can ALSO ride it as a mount, by choosing "Company chocobo". You can also change its color/outfit!                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Chocobo Companion  |                                | You can summon your chocobo anywhere you can fight overworld mobs, including fates. The DPS isn't great, it can't tank for you, but it sure as shit heal! 1 gysahl green = 30 minutes of IRL time it'll be summoned. You also cannot summon it if you have it stabled at your house/the fc house. You need to stable it to change its color. Riding your summoned choco using the company choco command also halts the timer for companion, good way to save on greens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Combat             | LIMIT BREAK                    | Limit break is shared among the party. Typically it's reserved for DPS (In this order: melee, ranged magic, ranged physical) to use to finish off the boss, and there's 3 different levels of it. If you hover over the icon it explains to you what each level does. Very rarely is it ever used by tanks, and in late game content/raids where you can get 3 LBs. If most of the party is dead, healers will use it. You can find it by going to “Actions and Traits,” then “General.” Put it on your hotbar!                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Raid               | STATICS                        | Static(s) is a term used to describe a group of people who run content together. Typically it is in an organized fashion with specific dates/times/nights of the week that you meet and get together for a common goal (typically progressing through difficult content, learning fights, etc.) There’s a group-organization channel in Discord that you can check for more info                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Raid               |                                | Every expansion past ARR has 12 “normal” raids which holds a full party (8 people), 3 "Alliance" which holds 3 full parties (totaling 24 people), and several full party "Trials" (story-related bosses). Most of these are unlocked through MSQ, or through side quests (blue quests with “+”s on them). There's roulettes tied to these different categories. Also, raids can be Normal, Savage or Ultimate, trials can be Normal, Hard, Extreme, or Unreal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Raid               | ALLIANCE RAID                  | Crystal Tower is an example of an Alliance Raid. It's required before you can do 5.0, and generally you should do all your post-patch side quests to unlock these things as they unlock daily roulettes, but take your time :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Trials             | EXTREME                        | You should never queue for synced extreme trials (ex trials) through duty finder. They require dedication to mechanics, so running them with people who are half-assing and don’t want to be there can be impossible. Finding a group via party finder is a lot more reliable. If you want to run any lv 50 ex trials, you can reliably solo them as a lv 80 (or ask the fc to help). Lv 60 trials require maybe 2-3 people, lv 70/80 require a full party and require tons of practice and watching videos. You'll only ever queue with two types of people: mentors angry that they got stuck in an EX synced trial, and sprouts who didn't know of the pain to come and may not know mechanics or how to even play their classes. |
| Combat             | UNSYNC                         | You can unsync content by clicking on the duty finder's settings gear in the top left corner. You can then select "Undersized party" and that will let us complete content as our max level and will not sync down our levels to meet the duty's level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| PVP                | FRONTLINES                     | Frontlines is objective-based PVP content with slightly different mechs on each map. Some people try to coordinate over /alliance chat, which shows as orange. There's 3 factions, and you get randomly thrown in one. Your goals are: 1. Capture the flags or kill objectives (oovoos/etc) on the maps. 2. Try not to die as this will give the other team points. 3. Kill other people- pay attention to which team is ahead. 4. The longer you stay alive, the more damage you do (“heat of battle”).                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Roulette           | MSQ ROULETTE                   | Castrum Meridianum and Praetorium are notoriously long. They have unskippable cutscenes, players rush through them b/c they're a part of a daily roulette, and an awful experience for sprouts. Let your party know if you’re new so you don’t get left behind and grab snacks for the cutscenes :) Don't worry too much, the whole thing is a meme... they like to pull all the mobs to the end to get the most out of their aoes :P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Leveling           | TIPS                           | Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkj8YvVE3l8) for a decent leveling guide. TL;DR: MSQ is always best for leveling, but you'll out level it so we suggest you grab a second class to level in tandem. Every level: All Daily roulettes except guildhests. LV 1-20: Hunt log, Lv 21-60: Squadron missions (In your grand company) or PoTD, 61-70: HoH, 71-80: Bozja or Pixie beast tribe. Every week, Wondrous Tails gets you half a level of exp. Best way to complete lv79.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Squadron           | RECRUITS                       | Go to your challenge log > there's different categories. Any time you complete one of those challenges you have a chance to trigger a recruit to show up at your barracks once per week. (This is on the weekly reset every Tuesday morning at 4am). Each category can recruit different recruits, there's 5 of each gender for a total of 10 per race.  You can only trigger one recruit per category per week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Squadron           | RECRUITS                       | Squadron recruits are recruited by completing tasks in your challenge logs. There are a total of 10 recruits of each race, and 5 of each gender per race. They all have different "reasons'' for joining you, which are the same categories as you have in your challenge log. When you complete a challenge log item you have a CHANCE of getting a recruit. You only get ONE recruit per category per week (resets every Tuesday w/ every other timer). You can buy manuals from your GC to increase chances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Squadron           | SUMMARY                        | Squadron is a team of 8 NPCs of your choice. They can serve as party mates in place of other players for select dungeons in squadron Command Missions, often as an alternative for leveling a DPS job. New squadron recruits may become available upon completing challenge log entries, up to one recruit per category per week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Gearing            | ORNATE                         | Ornate armor can have 5x lv 8 materia put in it and it's BIS (best in slot) for week 1 of an expansion. Great beginning of the patch if you're racing for stuff like world first clears. You can grab some through the Wondrous Tails rewards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Retainers          | LEVELING RETAINERS             | The way that I like to level retainers is by sending them on quick ventures nonstop. They are completed once per hour and this is the "random roulette" where you can basically get anything. You will get tons of blue and green equipment, which you should turn in for seals at your Grand Company and exchange them for more ventures to send them out on more quick ventures (see how it works?) Randomly they will bring you back high value items such as General Purpose White/Black Dyes, which you sell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Retainers          | RETAINER GEARING               | You don't have to worry about upgrading your retainer's gear until you start sending them on their class-specific ventures. There are 1 hour ventures and 18 hour ventures. The 18 hour ones will have strict stat requirements, and the higher it is the better reward you are likely to get. Make note of what stat it requires, bc for example on gatherers you don't need perception just gathering, so gatherers dont need accessories while combat retainers do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Gearing            |                                | [Jenji’s FFXIV Savage Raid Loot Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WUSU8iCfL4GHpHX89okK-NiFNOSHSJ6W8VOsFEZmT4k/edit#heading=h.mha1qn6yt717) The current end game gear consists of ilvl 530 gear. The Edenmorn pieces can only be obtained through savage raiding (the hardest raiding tier right now for 8-man raids), or you can get the Augmented Cryptlurker gear. The Augmented Cryptlurker requires you to buy Cryptlurker gear with Tomes of Revelation and then augment them using specific items. Left side equipment requires Crypt Twine, right side requires Crypt Dusting.                                                                                                                                       |
| Gearing            |                                | Something important to note is that the “current tier” of end game raids will most likely have weekly loot restrictions.This means that no matter how many times you run that, you will only ever get rewards ONCE. You can identify them by going to the “Information” part of the Duty Finder after selecting the raid you want to look at and see if it says “Awards Obtainable: Weekly”. In the Alliance raids, you will get a coin the first time you run it and you can only obtain ONE equipment drop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Gearing            |                                | You can pick what equipment item to roll for from the alliance raids. So if you run the first raid of the week, and you don’t get an item drop you want or if you didn’t win a roll, you will see under your duty finder “2/3 rewards obtained” at the bottom of the info page. You can run as many times as you need to in order to get the equipment you want, but you will only ever get ONE reward of each category it’s giving. However You can roll for the minions/scrolls/hairstyles as much as you want.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Gearing            |                                | As far as the Eden raids are concerned, you will only get rewards the FIRST TIME you run them each week. Per week, you get one book from each raid (can be traded for gear). If all players have NOT cleared that week, two chests appear. 1-5 NOT cleared, 1 chest. If you queue in to a later raid in the series without completing/getting rewards for one before that then you ARE FORFEITING YOUR WEEKLY REWARDS regardless if you clear or not. (Aka. DO NOT Queue in to E10S before you get rewards for E9S)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Gearing            | MATERIA                        | You get Crypt Twine and Dusting from Sack of Nuts exchange, by trading in a specific weekly book you get from the savage raids, or from turning in one of each of the coins you get from the 3 alliance raids in Shadowbringers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Gearing            | MATERIA                        | Right off the bat, I always advise to not worry about materia until level 80. The stats provided at lower levels are not worth the cost/time consumption of using materia on gear you’re gonna be switching in and out of rapidly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Gearing            | RELIC WEAPONS                  | Every expansion pack has something called a “Relic weapon”. While the expansion is “current content”, they will typically be end game weapons with the best stats. They are super grindy to get, have several “steps” towards completion, and you should definitely look up a guide to do them. A Realm Reborn = Zodiac weapons, Heavensward = Anima weapons, Stormblood = Eureka, Shadowbringers = Rebellion/Save the Queen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Miscellaneous      | REFERRAL CODE                  | You can generate a referral code and refer a friend. You can do this after they buy the game but BEFORE they subscribe. VERY IMPORTANT that they don’t subscribe until they redeem your referral code. Once they redeem it, you both get chocobo feathers (gold and silver, used for different things), and there’s feather exclusive mounts as well as other stuff that helps people get started/assists you in getting neat shit. [Referral info from SE.](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/friend_recruit/)                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Before logging in, click on the gear next to the character and you can upload your current config to the server… then download it where you want. VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure to do it FIRST on the computer with the settings you wanna back up (for both steps).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Go down to log filters on the first tab and you can change these to your liking. You can rename the last two tabs by right clicking on them under the chat window, but not the first two. If you want to change the 3rd tab to just FC, you would click on the tab name under the log filters menu, click on the “Uncheck all” button, then go to the chat tab and select free company and then hit apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

You collect stamps by running the content it requires in order to get cool weekly rewards. If you ever are about to run a new piece of content, just give us a shout here on FC chat. If people with books run content with players who haven’t completed it before, we get points for the books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

It’s always worth getting it every week on Tuesdays. You technically have 2 weeks to complete each book, but you can get one new book a week so it’s recommended you do them weekly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

You can purchase lv 1 and lv2 actions from the grand company if you are high enough rank in an FC and you can activate them if you have the right rank. Each lasts 24 hours. In order to get lv 3 buffs, you have to craft them at the fc shop and then charge them for 3 days in the aetherial wheel stand. You can only charge 1 buff at a time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| FC Messages        | RULES                          | We have some somewhat nebulous rules, but here’s what I expect in FC chat: 1. We assume everyone is at least 18. If you are below 17, do NOT state your age. I haven’t kicked anyone because of their age yet, but this is NOT a family friendly place. 2. RESPECT EACH OTHER. 3. No graphic detailing of sexual acts/other shit to anyone, especially if they are not consenting. 4. We can totally be pervy, suggestive, and playful, but if you ever wanna stop, let the chat know and it must be respected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                    |                                | The game's skills are divided into two categories: Global Cool Downs (GCDs) and Off Global Cooldown (OGCDs) skills. GCDs happen every 2.5 seconds and OGCDs can be cast any time around that. The best way to improve your performance in game is to "ABC" - Always Be Casting. That means NEVER miss a GCD "window" (aka. you should always click a GCD when it's up, every 2.5 secs), and "Weave" in your OGCDs in between. This maximizes DPS and helps you get better at your class :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

While flying, mounts have 200% speed of a regular running mount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|                    | wondroustails                  | The best part about wondrous tails is that even if you get no lines you still get 50% of a level worth of EXP from it. It's always worth getting it every week on Tuesdays. You technically have 2 weeks to complete each book, but you can get one new book a week so it's recommended you do them weekly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

You can purchase lv 1 and lv2 actions from the grand company if you are high enough rank in an FC and you can activate them if you have the right rank. Each lasts 24 hours. In order to get lv 3 buffs, you have to craft them at the fc shop and then charge them for 3 days in the aetherial wheel stand.
