# "Althaia's Guide to Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Final Fantasy 14"
(Title provided by Mountain King)
### or how i learned to stop worrying and love the catgirls (Spice Addict)

**This is where the disjointed bits of a big guide i'm working on will live. You can't send messages here, but you can at least read the WIP... Maybe it'll be helpful in the meantime**


###### General Gameplay tips
1. Focus on MSQ first. There is a large amount of content locked behind MSQ progression, and you will get the most out of the game the further down the story you are. Here's some notable examples:
    1. The *Althaia recommended* method of leveling your crafters and gatherers is unlocked after completion of 3.0 MSQ Heavensward Expansion. This is called the Firmament, and it's the best way to grind your crafters/gatherers to level cap. Please check out the guide linked here for more info.
    2. I suggest you level them all at the same time, as this saves you inventory space on equipment since that's limited. If you wanna make gil fast though, culinarian/alchemist are the consumable crafting classes which make u more money imo than just straight up crafting other stuff. If you wanna make gil you also should level your gatherers to cap and gather ur own stuff. More profit that way. Ultimately you will spend a TON of time monitoring the market place, tracking prices, etc.

###### Inventory management
You have several places where you can store items:
    - **Inventory** (Keyboard shortcut: i)
        - Capacity: 4 tabs of 35 slots (140 total)
    - **Chocobo Saddlebag** (keyboard shortcut: SHIFT + i)
        - Capacity: 2 tabs of 35 slots (70 total)
            - * Note: Can be expanded by purchasing the monthly subscription to the Companion $5/month App. Will double your saddlebag space
    - **Armoury Chest** (Keyboard shortcut: CTRL + i)
        - Capacity: 1 tab of 35 slots for each equipment item type
            - * Note: This will change when belts are removed with the release of 6.0
    - **Retainers** (Can be accessed at a bell, after completing [this quest](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/The_Scions_of_the_Seventh_Dawn_(Quest))
        - Capacity: Each retainer has 5 tabs of 35 slots (175 total), can also hold gil and will hold gil that you get from your market board sales.
        - You get 2 retainers for free, and can purchase 7 extra retainers for $2/month for each. You can additionally get a 10th retainer from purchasing the $5/month Companion App subscription.
            - * Note: Retainers do a lot more for you than just hold stuff. Read the retainers section for more info, but they are basically your extra storage, your way to sell on the market board and a great source of rare materials/items through their Ventures. 
    - **Glamour chest**
    - **Armoire**
	
	
###### General inventory tips
These are suggestions for new players. There are further opinions on this stuff in regards to materials for crafting/leveling up crafters, but this section will continue with the assumption that you are not concerned with leveling crafters yet.
    1. Don't hoard materials. You can typically get items back easily, and most items can be purchased with gil. 
    2. If you do keep any materials, assess whether you need both the HQ version and the NQ version. Lowering the HQ quality items to NQ can help consolidate a lot of inventory slots. You don't typically need HQ versions unless they are specifically required for a quest or if you need the HQ boost to getting HQ Crafts accomplished.
	
	General train of thought when it comes to "What do i do with this item I don't want?", if you answer "No" to a question, move on to the next one.
1. Is it rare or can I not obtain it again? (Aka. Mogstation items can't be reacquired after throwing them away, meaning you'd have to buy them again. Some class items can be purchased again at the Calamity Salvager NPC in the FC house or in town, but not all. Always check there before you throw away a piece of equipment)
2. Do I need it for a quest/event/future use? You should keep any equipment obtained through tomestones, as those tend to be multi-class and you can use them to level up other jobs. If all your classes are at 80, though, you may not need it.
3. Is it green/red/blue equipment? These items are drops from duties/dungeons. Typically they are used for glamour, but if you don't like how they look I suggest you turn them in to your Grand Company for Expert Delivery or save them until you can turn them in.
4. 



1. Don't hoard anything. You can get evrytrhting back easily. Gil doesnt buy anyhing actually important in this game, important gear is bought w tomestomes/other qurst stuff

 Chekc prices at market board BEFORE selling to vendor

You can also check MB hover over item + see if it says "shop price" > means u can buy in a vendor and dont have to pay mb prixe
 3. Stuff takes long to sell from MB only bb/c someone undercuts u. Check + update ur prices at least once a day
 Its ok to undercut by 1 gil

# Helpful text commands:

`/isearch &lt;item name>`

`/sea`

Will show you in zone people

`/sea forename xxxxx`

Gives you people with firstname

`/sea surname xxxx`

Gives you last name searches
