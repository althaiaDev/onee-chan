#Overview

We are all here because we share the common goal of supporting the growth and success of our Free Company. Below are some guidelines to help you, but you are trusted to use your best judgement and common sense should the situation call for it. Officers must comply with all FC Code of Conduct and any of the FC Rules or Regulations, no exceptions. Any individual in a position representing the Free Company will be held to higher standards than a regular member. 

Please note, that in most situations listed below if there is no Senior Officer online, then a Junior Officer is expected to assist or act as required to uphold the FC rules and maintain a healthy and fun environment. 

**Any in-game conversation requiring disciplinary actions and any actions taken by a Free Company Staff Member is expected to be screenshot for documentation and review purposes. No exceptions.** 

- Officers, Junior Officers and, to an extent, Volunteers are viewed as exemplary members of our community. You are here to set the golden standard and example by which everyone else will conduct themselves. You are expected to greet people as they log in, participate in events and engage with the community at large. While you don’t have to be at 100% every day or at all times, there is an expectation that you will help cultivate and grow the community we want to have, and set an example for others to follow.
- If any members are engaging in disruptive behavior in game or in the discord, Senior Officers are expected to intervene. Junior Officers may defer to any Senior Officer online, or request assistance from someone through Discord if no one is online, they can intervene if the situation is severe enough but the recommendation is to take any screenshots that you can to document the situation and report it through the private officer channels on discord.
	- Any intervention may consist of a warning, private conversation, strike, or in extreme situations, removing the offending party from the Free Company. 
- Regardless of role or rank, any disrespect towards anyone else will not be tolerated. 
- Any and every disciplinary action must be reported in the appropriate discord channel and recorded through YAGPDB promptly. 
- Any and all communication, discussions and topics conducted through a private Free Company Staff Member chat channel in game or on discord is confidential. No quoting or sharing information from any of these channels.   
- If you are unable to follow your duties, please notify a person in the rank above you or the FC Leader. If you need to take a break from the game, if some stuff came up for you outside of the game, or if you wish to step down from your position, please try to communicate your intent as soon as you make the decision. 
- Any misconduct by Officers, Junior Officers and Volunteers will be documented. While the three strikes policy also applies to them, their actions may be viewed under closer scrutiny and any actions taken by them will be held to a higher standard.
	- Severe enough misconduct can and will lead up to a demotion with no chance to be reinstated in the future.
- Officers are expected to participate in Free Company events as often as their own personal schedules allow. We are here to grow a community, have fun, and help each other achieve our own goals. A large part of that is participation from the Staff Members of the free company and how members and the community at large view our Staff Members. 
- Any Officer meetings are to be attended to the best of your ability. The FC Leader will try their hardest to ensure everyone can attend and find a good time for everyone, but if you absolutely cannot attend please notify the person leading the meeting.
	-  Unless there are extenuating circumstances, there will likely only be a meeting once a month or every other month. 
- Officers, Junior Officers and Volunteers are expected to join the discord and participate, moderate, and attend any relevant meetings there.
- There are different activity requirements for the different ranks, as listed below. Please notify the FC Leader or a Senior Officer should you need to take an absence from the game, so we can make sure your responsibilities are covered and so we don’t think you disappeared. 
- While you are not expected to log in every day, you have different expectations according to your roles, also listed below.
	- Seito Kaicho (Officer)
		- Last login: < 30 days 
		- You are expected to log in and fulfill your duties at least 4-5 times a week. 
	-  Hisho (Junior Officer)
		- Last login: < 45 days
		-  You are expected to log in and fulfill your duties at least 3 times a week.
	- Gakkyu Iin (Volunteer)
		- Last login: < 45 days
		-  As you are likely in a volunteer position with specific requirements, you will have logging in requirements according to the duty you have taken on.
		>For example: If we have 3 volunteers tending the onion farms, each of them must log in at least once every 3 days to make sure the farms are watered daily. This frequency is up to the volunteers to decide, and they can create their own shifts/schedules so long as it is communicated to the FC Leader. Any absences, or gaps in the schedule, are to be reported to the other Staff Member roles so someone can cover your duties during the absence.          
- Recruitment is only to be carried out by specific officers and volunteers. We are not here to spam the main hub towns and we do not want to get any such reputation, therefore we must coordinate carefully to ensure we are not spamming.
	- Before anything, your recruitment message must be approved by the FC Leader or a Senior Officer. If you want assistance crafting one, just let us know.
	-  When you post your recruitment message, do so through the /shout channel.
	-  You must talk to the person while recruiting them, and respond to any questions they may have. Try talking to the person and not just spamming a bunch of invitations. We want our members to feel welcome and to know that we are here to help. 
	-  You must ask them:
		-  “What are your preferred pronouns? (He/Him, She/Her, They/Them)” 
		> This question helps weed out anyone who would likely not fit into our community. We are first and foremost an accepting, LGBTQ+ friendly community. If someone cannot simply provide an answer to this question then they will likely prove to cause issues in the future or simply not fit in.
- Do not:
	- Randomly send Free Company invitations without the recipient expressly stating their desire to join. 
	-  Recruit through Party Finder.
	-  Harass anyone unwilling to join.
	-  Engage in any argument in /shout chat. Should someone respond rudely to your comments, screenshot the offender and relay the information and screenshot through discord so the FC Staff Member can discuss what happened.
	-  Advertise in each hub city more than once an hour, including the last time someone else advertised. 
- Try your hardest to interact with other members of the Free Company and keep members engaged. No one wants to feel left out, and no one wants to feel alone. Even if you don’t think it’s the case, some members may be thinking they don’t fit in or they aren’t part of the “inner circle of friends”. Please try to engage with every member and respond to people’s requests for help or to run roulettes and such, even if you have to say “Sorry, but i can’t right now.”. At least acknowledge them and their efforts. 
- Please follow the chain of command of the Free Company. For example, if you are having issues, please seek help from the rank directly above yours. Unless you are having issues with a person of a rank above yours, in which case you are to report any issues directly to the Free Company Leader.
