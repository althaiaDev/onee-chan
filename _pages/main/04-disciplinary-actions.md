# Overview

Officers are to utilize a three strike system as appropriate to the individual situation. If able to, they must communicate to the other officers before taking action or shortly after taking action. All infractions are to be tracked utilizing YAGPDB bot in the discord, regardless of where they occurred in game.

#### Three Strike System

Any violation of the rules will result in a strike. If you get three strikes, there will be a review of your behavior by the Free Company Owner and you will be banned or demoted accordingly. 

-   There are only two exceptions to this:
    
    -   Warnings may be given instead of strikes at the discretion of the Officers with approval from the Free Company Leader.
        
    -   The strikes system may be immediately bypassed, with Free Company Leader approval, if the infraction is severe enough.
        

#### Communicating Infractions, Warnings and Other Disciplinary Actions

-   If able to, the disciplining party must communicate to the other Officers and Free Company Leader before taking action or shortly after taking action.
    
-   The disciplining party must communicate clearly, calmly and concisely what transpired and why the person is getting a strike or warning in a private chat. 
    
    -   NOTE: If the action requiring discipline was performed in a wider audience and it can be used as a teaching moment, the Officers are allowed to address this in the channel of communication where it happened so that the person committing the action and others can learn that it is not acceptable behavior.
        
-   Officers and other Free Company Officials should avoid giving any direction that goes against any part of the Free Company Code of Conduct and any of the Free Company Rules or Regulations.
    

#### YAGPDB Infraction Guide (WIP)

-   These guidelines will serve as a small tutorial for how to use the YAGPDB bot to record warnings and infractions for members both in game and in the discord.
