# Overview

## Free Company Ranks
Ranks describe a member’s placement within the Free Company.  Different ranks hold different permissions and expectations.

[In-game Permissions by Rank](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hu3tCTpheF0cQ8sOWHauhYD0gJ41uZeN7C7AeRwDhAU/edit?usp=sharing)

All ranks, excluding “Onee-chan” and “Onii-chan”, are assigned by the owner of the Free Company, at her discretion.

# Free Company Chest

You are not allowed to grab items out of the chest just for the purpose of reselling them. These items are donated by community members for the purpose of giving away to anyone who needs them. Don’t abuse the system and ruin a good thing for everyone.

If you have more than one character please only take an item for a single character so that others may also have a chance to take what they need/want. If there are leftovers or extras later on check with an Officer about acquiring one for your other character.

## Contents 

-   Items Tab 1 
    
    -   Minions, Potions, Food, etc.
        
    -   Things in here are generally up for grabs for anyone to pick up if they don’t already have it.
        
-   Items Tab 2
    
    -   Dyes
        
    -   Feel free to grab any Dyes in here if you need them.
        
-   Items Tab 3
    
    -   General Crafting Materials and other items for the purpose of Gardening or Airship/Submarine/Free Company Workshop use.
        
-   Items Tab 4
    
    -   Items pertaining to Airship/Submarines and spoils returned from their ventures.
        
-   Items Tab 5
    
    -   TBA, Miscellaneous 
        
-   Crystals
    
    -   Crafting Crystals
        
-   Gil
    

## Conduct

-   **Deposit Only** – deposit of crystals and/or gil are considered donations to the Free Company, and are considered a part of “helping” other members.  Members granted access to deposit crystals and/or gil are under no obligation to do so.  All crystals should be utilized for crafting purposes and are not to be sold.  All Gil will be used to directly benefit the Free Company (e.g. upgrade housing, gifts for members, giveaways, welcome packages, etc.) at Officer discretion.  
    
-   **Full Access** – members granted full access to any page of the company chest are welcome to take what they need and are encouraged to replace what has been taken as they are able.  Items placed in the chest should be of use, and the Free Company primarily focuses on maintaining a supply of common minions, dyes and other helpful items such as Glamour Prisms.  As a reminder, members should not place items of personal value in the Free Company chest as these items can be retrieved by any member with full access.
