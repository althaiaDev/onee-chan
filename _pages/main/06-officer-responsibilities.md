# Officer Roles

Every Staff Member is expected to select a Specialty to focus on while executing their responsibilities. You should select the specialty that you feel you would find the most success doing, would be enjoyable for you to do, and could help you contribute to our community. If there are any activities that are not listed below, but you think would contribute to the Free Company and the community, please let the Free Company Leader know and they can look into it.

Additionally: Each specialty below will require someone to act as the Lead for the team. The Lead will be in charge of coming up with goals for their specialty with the Free Company Leader, coordinating with their team members to achieve the goals, and communicating with any other specialty’s Leader to cooperate where required. (example: Gatherers would need to communicate with the Workshop team to see what materials they need.)
