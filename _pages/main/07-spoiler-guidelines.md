# Overview
Please review the following information regarding in-game and discord spoilers. 

The discord has a special spoilers channel with specific guidelines, please review those as well.
{: .notice--warn}

## What counts as an Endwalker spoiler?

Ultimately we ask that you be flexible with us and help us prevent any type of story spoiler, even as minor as it might seem. This is a Free Company dedicated to helping adventurers who are beginning their journey and the story is one of the most important tenets of FFXIV’s greatness. The decision whether something is a spoiler is ultimately up to the FC Leadership. If you have any questions, or wonder if something you want to ask is a spoiler, please reach out directly to an FC Officer for guidance.

## Where you are in MSQ CAN be a spoiler in and out of certain contexts
Imagine you are on lv85 MSQ and someone is right behind you at lv84, if you mention "WHAT?? I'm already in a new area," then it spoils the whiplash YOU experienced because now the person behind you is expecting it. Even just linking an item from an EX trial will likely give away who the boss is due to the style and look of it. 

Avoid telling players to “get ready” or anything else that may build up too much anticipation for a specific story beat. I.e. “OMG i cried so hard at the end of that dungeon” or “dude get ready for it”, this tends to make big surprise moments not be surprises because they now know to expect some form of twist.

## Character names
Characters come and go and then come back again. It’s obvious at the start of an expansion that G’raha Tia has joined the party as of Endwalker due to the trailer. But the journey there is still a mystery. Try to avoid providing specifics like “Oh after they “died” in shb” or something like that, and if you know there’s a big surprise that isn’t readily revealed by the official media, avoid it at all costs. If you are currently at the part in MSQ where it's unsure if a character will come back, it's gonna hit a lot less hard if someone ahead of you were to say "(CHARACTER NAME)’s trust lines are really funny in the last dungeon!"

## Instance names
If you're about to queue into "Alphinaud's Abomination," the trial where you fight his freshly birthed baby, just call it trial #6 when you're recruiting in the Endwalker Linkshell.

## Location names
"Limsa Lominsa 2" is a spoiler because it implies the great migration of catgirls. WHY are the catgirls being driven out of their native homeland?!!!? 

## Linking items 
That really cool set of pajamas your WOL received for a quest, spoiling the fact that your WOL actually sleeps? Don't talk about it. Or else.

## Why is there a Linkshell if we can’t talk about Endwalker spoilers in it?

### Primarily, to keep Endwalker talk out of the general FC chat**

We are an FC that is focused on nurturing sprouts. With the release of Endwalker, there are a lot of new players along with returning players who aren’t caught up in MSQ. If the FC chat is flooded with Endwalker, it makes the environment less relevant to people who aren’t in Endwalker yet. We have also had instances of accidental spoilers being revealed through coordinating for trials and raids, so it’s safest to keep this confined to the channels of communication we are providing and out of FC chat.

### To coordinate dungeons, trials, raids and other expansion-relevant activities
“Who wants to do dungeon #4?”

### Talk freely about previous expansions
You don’t have to worry about talking in code or using tells when you want to talk about the plot of anything up to Shadowbringers.

**PLEASE NOTE:** If you’re talking about a non-Endwalker topic that does not contain spoilers, try to keep it to the general FC chat. The Endwalker Linkshell is not to exclude anyone, but to make for a more positive game experience for the FC! If you’ve finished END MSQ, there IS a spoiler friendly Linkshell! Make sure to get added to that.

## What should I do if someone is posting spoilers?
If you want to get involved, say something!

If the situation gets out of hand, the officers will deal with it. If you sense it was an accident, mention it to the person posting spoilers and it may end in a quick resolution. 

**Tell an officer**

If an officer isn’t online, use the discord’s ticket system to file a report. We will then determine if it was malicious, the severity of the situation, and repeat offenses. We will refer people back to these rules, reprimand, and/or discharge members if necessary.
