# Overview
A Spoiler is any description or hint of an important plot development in the game, which if you know it may reduce surprise or suspense for a first-time player. Anything can be a spoiler, regardless if your personal opinion deems it as such. For further guidance, please review the following information regarding in-game and discord spoilers. 

For the most part, things revealed through the media tour are fair game after about a week or two. Any big reveal in the game will never be ok to spoil, regardless of time elapsed since it's reveal. Approximately 3 months after the release of an expansion, we will lift the heavy restrictions from the general FC chat. No spoilers will still be allowed, but we will retire the use of special expansion-exclusive Discord Channels and in-game Linkshells.

# What counts as an Endwalker spoiler?

We ask that you be flexible with us and help us prevent **any** type of story spoiler, even as minor as it might seem. This is a Free Company dedicated to helping adventurers who are beginning their journey and the story is one of the most important tenets of FFXIV’s greatness. The decision whether something is a spoiler is ultimately up to the FC Leadership. If you have any questions, or wonder if something you want to ask is a spoiler, please reach out directly to an FC Officer for guidance.

--------------------------------------------

# Other considerations...
## Where you are in MSQ CAN be a spoiler in certain contexts!
Imagine you are on lv85 MSQ and someone is right behind you at lv84, if you mention "WHAT?? I'm already in a new area," then it spoils the whiplash YOU experienced because now the person behind you is expecting it. Even just linking an item from an EX trial will likely give away who the boss is due to the style and look of it. 

Avoid telling players to “get ready” or anything else that may build up too much anticipation for a specific story beat. I.e. “OMG i cried so hard at the end of that dungeon” or “dude get ready for it”, this tends to make big surprise moments not be surprises because they now know to expect some form of twist.

--------------------------------------------

# What 'bout... 
With the asterisk of "If it's been revealed in the media tour..." from the Overview above, the following pretty much universally apply.

## Character names?
It's a spoiler. Characters come and go and then come back again. It’s obvious at the start of an expansion that G’raha Tia has joined the party as of Endwalker due to the trailer. But the journey there is still a mystery. Try to avoid providing specifics like “Oh after they “died” in shb” or something like that, and if you know there’s a big surprise that isn’t readily revealed by the official media, avoid it at all costs. If you are currently at the part in MSQ where it's unsure if a character will come back, it's gonna hit a lot less hard if someone ahead of you were to say "(CHARACTER NAME)’s trust lines are really funny in the last dungeon!"

## Instance names?
Yep still a spoiler! If you're about to queue into "Alphinaud's Abomination," the trial where you fight his freshly birthed baby, just call it trial #6 when you're recruiting in the Endwalker Linkshell.

## Location names?
Does today end with y? Yup - still a spoiler. "Limsa Lominsa 2" is a spoiler because it implies the great migration of catgirls. WHY are the catgirls being driven out of their native homeland?!!!? 

## Linking items?
Yepperoni Macaroni. Still a spoiler. That really cool set of pajamas your WOL received for a quest, spoiling the fact that your WOL actually sleeps? Don't talk about it. Or else.

--------------------------------------------

# So what do we do when a new expansion/patch comes out?

According to the story importance, the potential for spoilerage, and Althaia's mood that day, the FC will take precautionary measures to help prevent spoilers including but not limited to:

1. Create 2 in-game Linkshells/Crossworld Linkshells to contain general patch chatter, coordination of dungeons, and questions. 
2. Create patch/expansion specific Discord channels and redirect all chat to those places.
3. Update these guidelines as necessary.

## Why is there a "Non spoilers Linkshell" and a "Spoilers Linkshell"?

- **Primarily, to keep any kind of spoiler talk out of the general FC chat**.
  - We are an FC that is focused on nurturing sprouts. With the release of a new patch or expansion, there are a lot of new players along with returning players who aren’t caught up in MSQ. If the FC chat is flooded with patch/expac chat, it makes the environment less relevant to people who aren’t in current content yet. 
  - We have also had instances of accidental spoilers being revealed through coordinating for trials and raids, so it’s safest to keep this confined to the channels of communication we are providing and out of FC chat.
- To coordinate dungeons, trials, raids and other expansion-relevant activities.
  - “Who wants to do dungeon #4?”
- You can Talk freely about previous expansions in the spoiler linkshells. 
  - You don’t have to worry about talking in code or using tells when you want to talk about the plot of anything up to the beginning of the current expac/patch.

**PLEASE NOTE:** If you’re talking about a non-Endwalker topic that does not contain spoilers, try to keep it to the general FC chat. The Linkshells are not created to exclude anyone, but to make for a more positive game experience for the FC! If you’ve finished the MSQ/Patch, there is a spoiler friendly Linkshell you can get added to, and discord channels where you can discuss the most recent way this game has destroyed your life.

## What should I do if someone is posting spoilers?
If you want to, then respectfully say something. If you sense it was an accident, mention it to the person posting spoilers and it may end in a quick resolution. If not, or If the situation gets out of hand, the officers will deal with it. 

If an officer isn’t online, use the discord’s ticket system to file a report. We will then determine if it was malicious, the severity of the situation, and repeat offenses. We will refer people back to these rules, reprimand, and/or discharge members if necessary.
